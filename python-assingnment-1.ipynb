    "        Python is considered a high-level programming language because it abstracts away many of the low-level details of computer memory and hardware that are required when programming in languages such as C or Assembly. This allows developers to write code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Additionally, the syntax of Python is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, making it a great choice for beginners."

    "        Python is called a dynamically typed language because the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile-time. In other words, you don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and the type of a variable can change at any time during the execution of the program.\n",
    "        In contrast, languages that are statically typed, such as C or Java, require you to explicitly specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and the type of a variable cannot change after it is declared.\n",
    "        This feature allows for flexibility and ease of use in python. For example, you don't have to worry about type mismatches or type conversions, and you can easily write code that works with data of different types. It also makes it easier to write generic code that can be used with multiple types of data.\n",
    "        However, it also mean that it is a bit harder to catch some errors or bugs, as the type of a variable may change without the developer noticing."
